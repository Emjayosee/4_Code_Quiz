# 01 Goal: The Goal of this project is .......  Here is a link to the Github folder https://github.com/Emjayosee/Assignment03 and a link to the deployed website https://emjayosee.github.io/Assignment03/.

# 02 Approach:

    In approching this project, I at first looked at the starter code provided, then found that there was not any starter code, so I realized I had to build this entirely from scratch. 

    I followed the following plan design:

        Code Quiz

            Goal:

            Develop a timed quiz on Coding and have it present a question, allow th user time to respond and go to the next question, advising the user if they are correct or incorrect and then keeping track of the scores and high scores.

            Design:
            •	Landing page to expain the rules, show the high scores;
            •	TBD

            Build:
            •	Set up three files, index.html, script.js and style.css
            •	TBD

            Validation:
            •	TBD
            •	TBD  
            •	TBD

            Once validated generate password and display on the page.

# 03 Testing and Quality Control:

    1. Test each of the criteria to confirm functionality.

    2. Format HTML Code to make it easier to follow when viewed at source.

    3. Load the files and tested the page functionality at GITHUB.

    4. Other...

    5. Other...

    6. Run the html through a code validation service on the final commit.  Use validator.w3.org and describe any issues and resolution.  Adjust before the final commit.
